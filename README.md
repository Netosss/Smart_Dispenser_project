project story : "Migdal Or" is an organization who employs people with visual impairments. Most of the work at the comapny combines work with a various of machines and each one using diffrent screws set and amounts. They find it difficult to count the screws and it is very difficult to distinguish between them.
In order to invent a solution to this problem, we built a robot who will receive a stack of screws and transfer them to various labeled containers according to identification and the needed amount.

As part of the robot creation process we have written useful code snippets that we will present here in the repostory.
